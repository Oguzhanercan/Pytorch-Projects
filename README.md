# Pytorch-Projects
Creating some projects by using different Neural Network architectures on PyTorch.

# 1-) Draw-Detect-Project

## About Project
- In this project, we classify a picture that we draw digitally by using convolutional neural network.
- The CNN was trained using MNIST data.

## Using Libraries :
- Pytorch
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
